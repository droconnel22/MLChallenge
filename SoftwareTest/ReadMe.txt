        /// Challenge Due - Run Length Encoding
        ///
        /// RLE is a simple compression scheme that encodes runs of data into
        /// a single data value and a count. It's useful for data that has lots
        /// of contiguous values (for example it was used in fax machines), but
        /// also has lots of downsides.
        ///
        /// For example, aaaaaaabbbbccccddddd would be encoded as
        ///
        /// 7a4b4c5d
        ///
        /// You can find out more about RLE here...
        /// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding
        ///
        /// In this exercise you will need to write an RLE **Encoder** which will take
        /// a byte array and return an RLE encoded byte array.
